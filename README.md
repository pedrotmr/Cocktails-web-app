# Juicy

Juicy is a web application which allow users to find different cocktail recipes in a visually appealing user interface and also post and share their own creations with all the users.

The app was created with the idea that everyone could enjoy a good cocktail at home, without having to go out and spend lots of money. Bartenders and creators may keep populating the app with new drinks and creations.
